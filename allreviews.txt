kevin harris, Love the smell in my truck.
jgarrettjo, Smells ok
Bettina B. Duckett, I take my dog everywhere with me & my grandson said my car smelled like my dog. So I use the car freshners & my car smells GREAT!!!
Tomi Collins Adebiyi, Lasting long
I'mchichi, Barely any scent what so ever.
Andreaalana, I’m giving a two stars because the fresheners project a strong scent, but the quality of the smell of the fresheners reminds me of cheap perfume. The lingering smell sours when the air is not flowing. I won’t buy again.
Dave, Used 3 out of pack and none worked.
gouD West, Right now I have one attached to my vent.A month later and the scent is still strong with some still left over.These pack of 6 should easily last me 6-8 months.
Eddie, Smells really good
Thomas J. Stewart, This product is crap. I’ve used it for a couple weeks and have never smelt it at all in My jeep. Usually having an air freshener clipped to the vent, especially if the heat is on, really brings out a fragrance. There is no fragrance at all with this I threw the rest of them away.
Toya, Let me just say this! It’s the best! ??. I had to reorder some for my dad and my boyfriend
Snapper, I have 2 in my car right now and you can barely smell them. Don't waste your money.
Emily Wills, The scent is great. The problem is that I put it on the passenger side vent & cannot even tell if it's on from the driver's seat. I can barely smell it from the passenger seat. Wish it was a little stronger since the scent is really nice.
Melanie, I bought it for my cars and this thing does not work at all. I thought it would probably take a few days but nothing. I would highly recommend to not buy it.
Joyce Schaffer, It’s a nice, subtle scent. As described.
Monique Johnson, Great product for refreshing your space. Highly recommended
SV, I like the scent. It’s crisp, citrusy and not too strong. 4 stars because the clip doesn’t always stay attached to my vent, and the product randomly falls off.
Mary, Smells really good…
Amazon Customer, This scent you can barely smell not as strong as I am used too
Amazon Customer, Bing
Zoë Watry, it smells so good and it lasts about 2 weeks to a month! highly recommend! good price too :)
1weirddude, Smells very nice and works as it should.
Tyrone Holmes, This is not a new car sent
Isha Fleming, The scent, green tea, is potent and I love the size of it; however, I don’t like the scent. I like fruity or fresh scents. The smell is more floral, so if you like floral scents give it a try.
daryl, Great price. Product does not last long.
Debra, Loved the value
Amy Elizabeth, This stinks so bad. Now I’m stuck with all of these and can’t return. Don’t get the berry.
Megan, It smells strong enough I just didn't like the scent I chose
Joe, It's working well so far. As for how long it will last only time will tell. Overall I am pleased with the purchase.
Lusta Anderson, I put 2 in my vents in my little Kia I got new car smell you can't even smell them. I even turned to vent only to get more smell nothing!
Jamie, Febreze is back. The old auto fragrances that don't even last a week anymore, that used to last for at least 30 days, I quit buying those. But then I saw these so I thought I'd buy some. And they are great and smell amazing.
Donald Carr, Would buy again. Give them a try.
Rayes, Car Freshner
Marlon Biggs, Great product smells great
kelly whittimore, Would recommend. Thank you
Jane O., It has a great sent and isn't over powering!
Daniel Cook, These are easy to use and great smell. They were also affordable and worth the value.
Summerr, Love them will buy again
Fred Browning, Great value and scent
Amazon Customer, Quality n scent really adds to the fragrance inside the car. I really enjoy the scent not to strong just right !
Y.M., I attach to my air vents at home. Adds a pleasant and subtle scent.
Leonora, These cartridges have virtually no smell. Waste of money. The Fabreeze air fresheners are more expensive but since these have no smell, the extra cost is worth it. I bought two fragrances and neither have a strong scent.
Jim Kelley, Great way to freshen the air in your vehicle! Easy to install right on your air vents. I especially liked the ability to adjust how much scent was released
Santiago Galan, doesnt last , dont buy it
Erin Macari, I like the control tab on the back to open as wide, or as little, as you want!
Chelsea Lanier, As described.
Amazon Customer, My grandson liked these.
B. J., Love this is easy to use and that it isn't a strong smelling. Just light smell and easy to use!! Highly recommend!!
becky, No smell at all
sandra walsh, These don't smell much at all
