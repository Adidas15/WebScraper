kevin harris, Love the smell in my truck.
gouD West, Right now I have one attached to my vent.A month later and the scent is still strong with some still left over.These pack of 6 should easily last me 6-8 months.
Toya, Let me just say this! It’s the best! ??. I had to reorder some for my dad and my boyfriend
Snapper, I have 2 in my car right now and you can barely smell them. Don't waste your money.
Monique Johnson, Great product for refreshing your space. Highly recommended
SV, I like the scent. It’s crisp, citrusy and not too strong. 4 stars because the clip doesn’t always stay attached to my vent, and the product randomly falls off.
Zoë Watry, it smells so good and it lasts about 2 weeks to a month! highly recommend! good price too :)
daryl, Great price. Product does not last long.
Debra, Loved the value
Joe, It's working well so far. As for how long it will last only time will tell. Overall I am pleased with the purchase.
Jamie, Febreze is back. The old auto fragrances that don't even last a week anymore, that used to last for at least 30 days, I quit buying those. But then I saw these so I thought I'd buy some. And they are great and smell amazing.
